I created a directory called test then i removed the execute permissions from the file using chmod

After doing this I was unable to write to the file but I was able to read from it using ls, as there was nothing in my directory I decided to test this by creating a new directory then adding a file and removing execute permissions.

Upon lsing the directory I was able to see the total of 1 files in the directory

Using ls -a in my current directory showed me the difference in reading permissions for my user group when i removed them using chmod u-x

[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ mkdir test2
[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ cd test2
[matthew23fa@sjsu test2]$ touch file.txt
[matthew23fa@sjsu test2]$ cd ..
[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ chmod u-x test2

when I tried to mv the directory without creating a temp3 dir it successfully copied the directory to a new destination temp3 and removed the previous directory

I then experimented to see if I could cp to a nonexistent directory and it refused to do so unless I created a new one.

To recurssively copy every file in a directory you would have to create a new directory then use the cp -r command with the destination directory passed as the last argument

I did this as follows:

[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ mkdir temp2
[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ cd temp2
[matthew23fa@sjsu temp2]$ touch file.txt
[matthew23fa@sjsu temp2]$ cd ..
[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ cp -r temp2 temp3
[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ cd temp3
[matthew23fa@sjsu temp3]$ ls
file.txt

[matthew23fa@sjsu ~]$ cd /proc
[matthew23fa@sjsu proc]$ ls | grep "cpu|mem"
[matthew23fa@sjsu proc]$ ls | grep -E "cpu|mem"
cpuinfo
iomem
meminfo

using the grep command to find cpu and mem info I came to the conclusion that these were the memory and cpu information files and
verified this by opening them with vim

When I used the command to see all the processors (cat cpuinfo) it listed out all 255 processors and their corresponding information.

It appears that there are 255 processors on the machine of the POWER8 architecture with a clockspeed of 3425Mhz or 3.425Ghz

Using this command I found out that the system was running Red Hat Linux.
The system file containing this was system-release.
