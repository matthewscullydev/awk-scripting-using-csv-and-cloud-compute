cut -d "," -f 2,17 2019-05.csv | grep -E "2019-05-11" | cut -d "," -f 2

when I input this the output is a bunch of rows with the total amount on each.


[matthew23fa@sjsu taxidata]$ cat total_amounts_05-11.txt | tr '\n' '+' | sed 's/+$/\n/' | bc
4509482.36

this is the output before I append it to totalnumber.txt

wc -l total_amounts_05-11.txt | cut -d " " -f >> totalnumber.txt

I then append the line count and modify the totalnumber.txt file using vim to allow it to work with the final bc command as documented in my a2.txt entry for this problem
