First I used this script to save the top 100 dropoff locations from the pickup location 234.0

cut -d "," -f 8,9 2019-08.csv | grep -E "234.0,.*" | cut -d "," -f 2 | sort -k1,1nr | uniq -c | sort -k1,1nr | head -n 100 | awk '{print $2}' > dolocations.txt

Then I created a bash script with the following code to iterate through every entry in the txt file and search for entries with the same dropoff location in the august csv

shellscript.sh
---------------

#!/bin/bash
output_dir="/mnt/scratch/matthew23fa/taxidata/cs131/ws5/do234"
mkdir -p "$output_dir"

# Read and preprocess data from 2019-08.csv into an array
mapfile -t augustdropoffs < <(cut -d "," -f 9 2019-08.csv)

# Iterate through the patterns in dolocations.txt
while IFS= read -r entry; do
            # Use grep to filter lines in augustdropoffs array that match the current entry
                grep -E "$entry" <<< "${augustdropoffs[@]}" > "$output_dir/$entry.txt"
        done < "dolocations.txt"

afterwards I use wc -w on each file requested to find out how many entries there are per requested dropoff location

[matthew23fa@sjsu do234]$ wc -w 48.0.txt
6073358 48.0.txt
